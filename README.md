# Internet-Radio-Using-Multicast
Implemented an Internet radio which runs on different stations and supports multicast. UDP is used for transmitting data packets of video/audio and TCP is used for establishing the connection. Radio has the functionality of play, pause and change station options along with concurrent users. GUI and content management(Streaming live using WebCam) was also done.
